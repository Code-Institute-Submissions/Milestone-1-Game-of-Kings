# Design

## Colour Scheme

The site features a few choice colors being :
- **Dark Cyan-Blue** similar to **Black Pearl** (#111f28),
- **Snowfall** (#dfddda), 
- **White** (#fff), 
- **Black** (#101010), 
- **Grey** similar to **Trout** (#484e52),
- **Baltic Sea** (#343a40)
- **Pale red** (#f8d7da)
- **Amaranth** (#dc3545).

These colours were chosen to give a **dark, moody** feel to the website but not have it so dark that it was not a user friendly environment.
Also some of the colors were used to give a chess feel with the contrast between black and white the most obvious chess colours apparent throughout the site.
The 2 exceptions being the alert color of **Pale red (#f8d7da)** and button color **Amaranth (#dc3545)** which were used to add good visual contrast and draw the users attention to these areas.

## Fonts 

- The site mainly uses the **"Lobster"** font for easyness to read as there is not much styling to it and it gave a sort of "chessy" feel to the site and it has a fallback of **"sans-serif"**.
- The **italics** areas contained within the homepage and events pages were styled with **"Inconsolata"** with a fallback of **"sans-serif"** also,
to give a good separation visually of important information within the text. 

## Imagery

The images used are all **chess related**. I thought it was important to have a consistant theme of visually striking images,
that were all close enough in subject matter and color to make a consistent feel across the site.The color of the images was important to have good crossover with the site **color scheme** and 
I believe the images chosen fit very well overall as the relate to the subject matter but also provide good impact both visually in arrangment and colour wise.

### Wireframes

- The wireframes were created using **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGkJ6iKra1Rpbr_P_NWTlH_xSyg5fnl9cG87m1uVtg1HJKb3bCsG0BhoC3yMQAvD_BwE)** and were used as a rough guideline towards the finished product visualisation.

# Bugs and Fixes
- Wireframes not showing when linked as an image to readme file.
  - Solution was to upload the wireframe.pdf to Github and then link the file path to the GitHub location in the readme.
- GoK icon not linking to Homepage.
  - Solution was to fix spelling on "index".
- Issue with navbar not being sticky to the top of page.
  - Solution was to delete the wrapper class and restyle the alert which disappeared once the page was scrolled.
- Issue with display on right hand side for all pages with a white margin on the right hand side.
  - Solution was to add class to the rows instead of the container and to resize the image and alert.
- Issue with modal not taking reuired action and form still submitting with empty field.
  - Solution was to move modal inside of form element and change button type to submit.
- Issue with cards not displaying correctly images were not sized properly within card.
  - Original solution was to give cards a fixed size but from research this approach was abandoned and I gave them a minimum height instead.
- Contact form was filling full screen to right hand side but had margin on left.
  - Fixed with media query adding margin for mobile screens.
- Some display issues due to margin top and margin bottom being used.
  - Solution was to implement padding Y axis class and margin Y axis class in bootstrap.
