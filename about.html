        <h3 class="elo-heading text-center">The Elo System Explained</h3>
         <p class="elo-main">The Elo System (used by the United States Chess Federation, FIDE, and many other online chess sites) 
         is popular for two reason - it has been around for a long time, and it is simple. The idea is this: given two chess players of different strengths, 
         we should be able to calculate the % chance that the better player will win the game.
          For example, Garry Kasparov has ~100% chance of beating my 4-year-old daughter.
          But he may only have a ~60% chance of beating another Grandmaster. So when playing that other Grandmaster, if he wins 6 games out of 10, his rating would stay the same.
           If he won 7 or more, it would go up, and 5 of less, his rating would go down. Basically, the wider the spread of the ratings, the higher percentage of games the higher rated player is expected to win. 
           So to calculate a person's rating after playing a few games you calculate the average ratings of his opponents, and then how many games he was expected to win, and then plug it into a formula that spits out the new rating.
            Simple enough. Well, it turns out, that is maybe TOO simple.</p>
            <p>
            With the Elo system you have to assume that everyone's rating is just as sure as everyone else's rating. 
            So my rating is as accurate as your rating. But that is just not true. 
            For example, if this is your first game on Chess.com and you start at 1200, how do we really know what your rating is? We don't. 
            But if I have played 1,000 games on this site, you would be much more sure that my current rating is accurate.
            This is where systems such as the The Glicko System (used by Chess.com, the Australian Chess Federation, and some other online sites) comes
            into play. You can learn more about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">here</a>.
